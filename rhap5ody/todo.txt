- implement listeners for defaults properties
- build positional functions such as center(), padding(), margin() etc..
- construct larger demo with more objects
- more custom targeting logic (eg: custom id & classes) //started
- implement mouseClicked and others
- fix setting rebuilding multiple times if multiple sets
   - ie. batch rebuilds by some index if set in same function context
- effects+mouseClicked for all elements //done mouseClicked
